# Robot Localization

The project was made for artificial intelligence classes.  
The template comes from [here](https://github.com/jwietrzykowski/proj_lokalizacja).

# Goals
+ write an alglorithm which estimates the probability of the robot's position in the world
+ implement a robot's heuristics so that robot will choose localization which can give it more information about its position

# Assumptions
+ the robot doesn't know its position and orientation
+ the robot has a 5% chance to not perform the move provided  in the command
+ the robot's sensors have a 1% chance to return wrong information about the environment around the robot
